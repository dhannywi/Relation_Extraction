# Relation Extraction on MIMIC-III Data
AI in Health group project in collaboration with Dr. Yifan Peng from Cornell Medicine. Group members include Dhanny Indrakusuma, Redoan Rahman, and Patrick Sui.

The research project focuses on exploring differentpossibilities to build a successful model that can classify
the type of relation type available in a sentence of medical
text. In our research, we utilized a variety of feature
extraction methods such as TF-IDF, Bag-of-Words,
Word2Vec, Spacy, BERT, and Sentence-BERT. For the
classification task, we implemented models such as
Decision Tree, Random Forest, Long Short Term Memory
model et cetera. We found that in our smaller datasets,
simpler models do surprisingly better than the complex
model. We also found that SentenceBERT provides
excellent representation which improved the results for
almost all of the classification models.
